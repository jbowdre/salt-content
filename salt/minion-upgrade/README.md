# minion-upgrade (archive)

This module was originally created for helping to migrate Salt minions to the 3006+ "onedir" release.

It hasn't been updated for the [Broadcom migrated package repos](https://saltproject.io/blog/post-migration-salt-project-faqs/) and is likely no longer of use, but the content is sticking (for now) around as a reference.
